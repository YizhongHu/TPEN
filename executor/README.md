# tpen-executor

`tpen-executor` is the independent project boundary for TPEN execution
orchestration.  Its staged Hydra configuration preserves future-process
programs as unresolved specifications; owner processes materialize those
programs with their local environment.

Runtime dependencies are `hydra-core==1.3.2` and `omegaconf==2.3.0`.  The
development dependency is the same pinned pytest release used by the root
project.

From this directory, install the locked environment and run the executor
tests with:

```text
cd executor && uv sync --locked && uv run pytest -q tests
```
